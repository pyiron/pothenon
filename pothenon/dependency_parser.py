    """
    Recursively collect all callable dependencies of *func* via AST introspection.

    Each dependency is keyed by its :class:`~pyiron_snippets.versions.VersionInfo`
    and maps to the callables instance with that identity.  The search is depth-first:
    for every resolved callee that is a :class:`~types.FunctionType` (i.e. has
    inspectable source), the function recurses into the callee's own scope.

    Args:
        func: The function whose call-graph to analyse.
        version_scraping (VersionScrapingMap | None): Since some modules may store
            their version in other ways, this provides an optional map between module
            names and callables to leverage for extracting that module's version.
        _call_dependencies: Accumulator for recursive calls — do not pass manually.
        _visited: Fully-qualified names already traversed — do not pass manually.

    Returns:
        A mapping from :class:`VersionInfo` to the callables found under that
        identity across the entire (sub-)tree.
